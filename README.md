# sudoku_solver
A Sudoku solver written in python.

The sudoku_solver() function takes a 9 by 9 list where each cell is either an integer [0-9] or empty. The script starts by population the empty cells through inclusion (i.e. just one number is missing from the row/col/sqr) or exclusion (i.e. one number can go nowhere else in the row/col/sqr). For hard puzzles these rules are not enough and guesswork is required. The script uses recursion to guess numbers starting with the cells that have the fewest possibilities, it checks if the resulting sudoku is still solvable allowing false guesses to be identified quickly. If a single solution is found the scrip will return that solution as a 9 by 9 list. If the input is invalid or the sudoku has more than one solution an exception is raised. This script solved a test set of >100 puzzles on the servers at codewars.com within the 12 second time limit. Kata: https://www.codewars.com/kata/5588bd9f28dbb06f43000085
